This repo is a collection of assignments and mini-programs/projects for beginners trying to learn C.

**WARNING: During this excercise you will be learning along with me, I am not your teacher, but your peer. I don't know anything about writing robust/correct C, I'm learning just as you are learning. Do not think that these examples are correct.**
